Replacing it with document.querySelector or document.querySelectorAll we lose all that methods. How to migrate: Replace AUI.$(selector) with document.querySelector(selector) if expected result is one node. Replace AUI.$(selector) with document.querySelectorAll(selector) if expected result is more than one node. In this case you will have to iterate over the array to execute methods on each node if needed. Migrate methods: Some methods can't be directly replaced with native implementations so we may need to use some utilities from metal like metal-dom. To do it we need to import the module in the jsp in the following way let dom = metalDomSrcDom.default; ... let domData = metalDomSrcDomData.default; ... ### Direct replacements jQuery | replacement --- | --- .addClass() | dom.addClasses(element, classes) .append() | dom.append(parent, child) .attr(attribute) | .getAttribute(attribute) .attr(attribute, value) | .setAttribute(attribute, value) .closest() | TODO .collapse() | TODO .data() | domData.get(element, 'propertyName') .data(value) | domData.set(element, 'propertyName', value) .each() | .forEach .find() | .querySelector() or querySelectorAll() .formToArray() | TODO .html() | .innerHTML .html(value) | .innerHTML = value .map() | [...document.querySelectorAll(selector)].map() .on() | addEventListener() .one() | dom.once(element, eventName, fn) .prepend() | TODO .prop('property') | element.property .prop('property', value) | element.property = value .ready(fn) | document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', fn, false) window.addEventListener('load', fn,false) .remove() | dom.exitDocument(element) toggleClass('class') | dom.toggleClasses(element, 'class') .tooltip() | TODO .val() | .value .val(newValue) | .value = newValue ### Code replacements Replace .ajaxSubmit() with fetch(url, { body: new FormData(form), credentials: 'include', method: 'POST', ... }) .then(response = ...); Replace .load() with fetch(url, data) .then(response = { element.innerHTML = response; }); Replace .serializeArray() with form dom.exitDocument(element) Replace .sideNavigation() TODO.

[2] Move the search into the management toolbar Move the part in charge of the search into the liferay-frontend:management-bar section, right after the last of the liferay-frontend-management-bar-filters item like it's shown in the following snippet. Notice how the usage of aui:nav-bar-search from the original snippet is no longer necessary, but an additional `` item needs to be added. ... [3] Use clay:navigation-bar instead of the old aui:navbar tag Start by adding the following imports to the imports section of your init.jsp file: // Import the clay tld file to be able to use the new tag // Import the NavigationItem utility class to create the items model Don't forget to add the dependency with to the frontend-taglib-clay module in your build.gradle file: provided project(\":apps:foundation:frontend-taglib:frontend-taglib-clay\") Model your entries using the NavigationItem class and pass it down to the tag instance. The inverted attribute is set to true in all admin portlets. Instances in applications for live sites only can be left to false (default) [4] Extract application sections from the Actions Menu This step is optional but recommended All Application Sections should be clearly visible in the Navigation Bar. Consider exploring what options your application currently has in the Actions Menu (find instances of *PortletConfigurationIcon) to find section candidates. [5] Move the navigation items definition into a Display Context This step is optional but recommended If your application already supports it (or even if it doesn't), consider moving the Java portion that generates the navigation items model into a *DisplayContext pattern to keep your jsps cleaner and server-free Who has done it already?
