If url is not passed the icon svg is wrapped inside a span. Current taglib accepts param “data” that is only being used in product-navigation-control-menu-web/.../view_category.jsp and ClayIcon doesn’t accept this param. Current taglib accepts param “label”. ClayIcon doesn’t accept this param. Current taglib accepts params “target” and “url” to wrap icon inside a link with this attributes. ClayIcon doesn’t accept that. Current taglib accepts param “src” that now is called “spritemap”. If no spritemap is defined it will be setted automatically to themeDisplay.getPathThemeImages().concat(\"/clay/icons.svg\") Proposed solutions: Add “wrapped” boolean param to ClayIcon to wrap the icon inside a span. For the “data” param see if it can be used in a different way in that jsp For the label param: ClayIcon is to render an icon. If we want to print a label I’d print it apart. Target and Url params: Use clay:link. How to migrate: If is used as a link (passing url / target) use clay:link instead. Change cssClass param to elementClasses. Change image param to symbol. Change src param to spritemap. Remove “icon-monospaced” from classes and add the param monospaced equals to true.

Alert icons are predefined depending on the alert style (i.e. danger style - exclamation-full icon) targetNode was used to render component into a specific container. We need to make sure that this is really a need and, if so, make a different component with this behaviour. For now, this feature is not available. timeout param is no longer supported. Now the component has predefined an autoclosing time and to make an alert autocloseable we need to pass it the param autoClose=true. type param is now used to specify the type of the alert (regular, fluid or notification) and new param style take its place to define if is a danger, info, success or warning alert. How to migrate: Remove animationTime param. Remove icon param and make sure to pass the style of the alert (danger, info, success or warning). Make sure if targetNode is really needed and what we have to do can't be done in another way. If not... ask. Remove timeout param. If you want your alert to be closed automatically pass autoClose=true param. Use type param to specify wich kind of alert you need (regular, fluid or notification).
